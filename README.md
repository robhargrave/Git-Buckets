# Git-Buckets
Working project for creating a statistical model to be used in basketball wagering

This can be a long, casual project to explore git-hub functionality as well as posing an interesting, challenging problem that could potentially offer rewards in the end.

The goal of this project is to take a number of statistical categories, averages, and other factors of NBA players, and apply these ideas to a model in order to predict future performance. Basketball was chosen as the sport to work with, due to the large number of tracked offensive and defensive categories.
